## 🔮 Future Plans
We are just getting started! Here is what's coming next:

### 1️⃣ Render Distance Slider
> **Replaces the "Cycle" button**  
> Much faster and more precise control over your view distance. 

### 2️⃣ Visual Immersion & Feedback
> **[NEW] Advancement "Toast" Notification** 🏆  
> *Concept*: When you get an advancement, the entire Touch Bar **flashes gold** and scrolls the advancement title (e.g., "Stone Age") across the bar for 3 seconds.  
> *Why*: A huge dopamine hit that keeps chat clean!

> **[NEW] "Now Playing" Ticker** 🎵  
> *Concept*: When a new music track starts (e.g., "C418 - Sweden"), it **slides in** from the right, displays the track name, and fades out.  
> *Why*: Aesthetics matter. Adds a premium, native Spotify-like feel.

### 3️⃣ Main Menu Quick Actions
> Fast access to your favorite servers and singleplayer worlds directly from the main menu.

### 4️⃣ And much more to come! 🚀
